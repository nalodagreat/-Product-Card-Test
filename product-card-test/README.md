## Project Overview
This project is a responsive Product Card component built for an e-commerce product listing page. It features a modern and clean design with  smooth hover animations, and intuitive variant color selection.

## Layout Approach
The layout uses a card design that highlights product images and information clearly. The variant dropdown and quick color selectors allow users to easily switch between product options. I used Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and responsiveness.

## Responsiveness
The component adapts seamlessly across devices, with flexible image sizing and stacking content on smaller screens. Buttons and interactive elements scale appropriately to maintain usability on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages for deployment
